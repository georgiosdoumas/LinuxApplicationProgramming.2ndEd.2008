$ make -f Makefile.simpvar

ERRATA page 66  for a function call takes the general form of ${func arg1,arg2,...).
   correct is : for a function call takes the general form of $(func arg1,arg2,...).

   correct is : Lines 19 through 25 represent the header file dependencies.

ERRATA page 75 listing 7.1 must have a line #include <stdio.h>
ERRATA page 79 line 35 of listing 7.4 should better be: return 0; (not just: return; )

ERRATA page 179 near the end :
In this example, you open a new file called app_log and receive a file descriptor called fd1 .
Correct is :
In this example, you open a new file called app_log and receive a file descriptor called oldfd .

ERRATA page 196 listing 13.2 code line 12
int connectionFd, in, index = 0.limit = MAX_BUFFER;  -->change it to :
int connectionFd, in, index = 0, limit = MAX_BUFFER;

ERRATA page 206 last code snippet has 2 lines wrong (after --> I give the correct ) : 
struct sockaddr localaddr;    --> struct sockaddr_in localaddr;
....
getsockname(sock, (struct sockaddr_in *)&localaddr, &laddrlen);  --> getsockname(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&localaddr, &laddrlen);
